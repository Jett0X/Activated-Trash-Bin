# Activated-Trash-Bin
Evaluating the Operational Efficiency of the Solar Charging Sensor- Activated Trash Bin
<h4>
This study evaluates the operational efficiency of the solar charging sensor- activated trash bin as an alternative to traditional waste disposal systems. The research aimed to assess the device's durability, accuracy, sensor range, response time, power source longevity, and environmental adaptability. A quantitative experimental design was employed, utilizing surveys from 14 respondents to gather user feedback on performance. The study incorporated purposive sampling and data analysis through weighted mean calculations to determine satisfaction levels. Key findings indicate that the trash bin performed exceptionally well in durability (4.77), accuracy (4.73), and sensor range (4.71), ensuring reliable waste detection and disposal. Response time (4.47) was efficient, while power source longevity (3.79) and environmental adaptability (3.73) suggested areas for improvement. Overall, the computed average weighted mean of 4.72 falls within the "Highly Efficient" category, supporting the alternative hypothesis that the device significantly outperforms traditional bins.

 Despite its strong performance, limitations were observed in detecting specific waste types and waste management. Future research should explore an advanced automation that well segregate and determine specific types of waste. The findings highlight the bin's potential for modern waste disposal, promoting hygiene and sustainability through innovative solar charging sensor-based technology.
